<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
 * Build file for the OME Java Client (Shoola) Builder tool.
 * Use this file to build and deploy the Builder tool.
 * This is an Ant build file and requires Ant 1.6 or later to run the build.
 *
 * The Builer tool is a trivial Java program that invokes Ant to process the
 * OME-Shoola build file.  The Builder tool is packaged in a jar file which
 * is linked to all Ant and third-party libraries required to process the 
 * OME-Shoola build file.  Because all those libraries ship with Shoola's 
 * source, all is needed to compile, run, test, and package the application
 * for distribution is a JDK (1.4 or later).  This way, people won't have to
 * install/upgrade and tweak Ant to run Shoola's build file.  In fact, after
 * deploying the Builder jar ('build') in the same directory as the Shoola's
 * build file, it is possible to run a build without Ant:
 *
 *      java -jar build [target]
 *
 * Where target is one of the targets in the Shoola's build file.  Of course,
 * the Builder itself is deployed before hand and ships with Shoola's source.
 * (This is obviously because Ant is required to build the Builder.)
 *
 * ______
 * NOTES:
 * 1. Ant requires some XML libs to run.  The reason why those libs are not 
 *    incuded with the Builder tool is easy: JDK 1.4 and later already ship
 *    with implemetations of those libs and Ant 1.6.2 (the version we use)
 *    can work just fine with those JDK default libs.  (At least the tasks
 *    we use Ant for.)
 * 2. The way we invoke Ant is kinda lame, but works fine with all the tasks 
 *    currently in Shoola's build.  The potential problem is that we don't
 *    set ant.home and invoke org.apache.tools.ant.Main rather than the new
 *    Ant launcher.  Dunno if some tasks (among those we don't use yet) rely
 *    on that stuff.  (Ant launcher also does some classpath 'magic'.)
 *    Re-factoring this is not difficult, so we might wanna do it when we have
 *    more time.  Here's the plan:
 *    
 *      + Move all Ant and third-party jars in a 'lib' dir under 'tools'.
 *      + Make a build class which uses a custom class loader (or at least an
 *        URLClassLoader) to load org.apache.tools.ant.launch.Launcher with
 *        whatever args are passed from the command line.  This class loader
 *        will have its classpath set to ant-launcher.jar and tools.jar. 
 *        Given these settings and the above dir structure, the Launcher is
 *        smart enough to configure itself and Ant correctly.  (See code).
 *      + Nuke the current 'build' jar and replace it with the compiled build
 *        class file ('build.class').  Now a Shoola build can be run by typing:
 *          java build [target]
 *        from the dir containing Shoola's build.xml file.  Again, no previous
 *        classpath settings are required or extra command line args!
