  
  Open Microscopy Environment - Install Notes (Java Client - Mac OS X)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  _________________
  Install Procedure

  Extract the downloaded bundle in any directory on your local file system.
  After doing this, your directory should contain:

    * A "config" directory.
    * The "Shoola" application.
    * A "LICENSE" file.
    * This install file.

  Locate the "container.xml" file within the "config" directory and edit this
  file to specify the URL to the OME Data Server (OMEDS).  All you have to do
  is to modify the content of the url tag within the following entry:

    <structuredEntry name="/services/OMEDS" type = "OMEDS">
	  <url>http://valewalker.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola</url>
    </structuredEntry>

  You have to replace "http://valewalker.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola" with
  the actual OMEDS URL in use at your site.


  ____________________
  Running The Software

  Double-click on the "Shoola" application icon within the installation
  directory.  A splash screen will pop up.  Enter your OME user name and
  password, then press the log in button.  Enjoy OME!
