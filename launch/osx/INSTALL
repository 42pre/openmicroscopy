  
  Open Microscopy Environment - Install Notes (Java Client - Mac OS X)
  --------------------------------------------------------------------

  Install Procedure

  Extract the downloaded bundle in any directory on your local file system.
  After doing this, your directory should contain:

    * A "config" directory.
    * The "Shoola" application.
    * A "LICENSE" file.
    * This install file.

  Locate the "container.xml" file within the "config" directory and edit this
  file to specify the URL of the OME Data Server (OMEDS) and the OME
  Image Server (OMEIS).  All you have to do is to modify the content
  of the url tags within the following entries: 

    <structuredEntry name="/services/OMEIS" type = "OMEIS">
	  <url>http://yourhost/cgi-bin/omeis</url>
    </structuredEntry>

    <structuredEntry name="/services/OMEDS" type = "OMEDS">
	  <url>http://yourhost/shoola</url>
    </structuredEntry>

  You have to replace "http://yourhost/cgi-bin/omeis" and
  "http://yourhost/shoola"  with  the actual OMEIS and OMEDS URLs in
  use at your site. Most likely, this will simply involve changing
  "yourhost" to the name of your local host.


  ____________________
  Running The Software

  Double-click on the "Shoola" application icon within the installation
  directory.  A splash screen will pop up.  Enter your OME user name and
  password, then press the log in button.  Enjoy OME!
