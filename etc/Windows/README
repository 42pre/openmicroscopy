  OMERO.grid Windows customizations
  ---------------------------------

  This directory and the grid subfolder, contain modified
  versions of the same named files one directory level up
  (/etc). The primary reason for these is Ice's requirement
  for absolute paths under Windows. Here: C:\\omero is
  assumed as your installation directory.
  
  As of 4.0, the Python components also do not run properly
  on Windows, but you can run them on a separate server if
  necesssary.
