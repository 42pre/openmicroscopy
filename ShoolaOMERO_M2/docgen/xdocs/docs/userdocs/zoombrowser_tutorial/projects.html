<p> The project list can be used to identify datasets included in a
  project and to select a project for further
  investigation. Initially, all project names are printed in simple
  black font. Mousing over a project name selects it temporarily. The
  moused-over project name is printed in blue and slightly increased
  in size. All of the datasets contained in that project are
  highlighted in orange, and all of the other projects that contain
  any of those datasets are also highlighted. This provides an
  overview of the contents of each project, and the overlap between
  this project and other projects.</p>.
