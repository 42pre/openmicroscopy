/** 
 * Defines the interface provided by the fs importer component. 
 * The Viewer provides a top-level window hosting UI components to interact 
 * with the fs instance.
 *
 * When the user quits the window, the {@link #discard() discard} method is
 * invoked and the object transitions to the {@link #DISCARDED} state.
 * At which point, all clients should de-reference the component to allow for
 * garbage collection.
