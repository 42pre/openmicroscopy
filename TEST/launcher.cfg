# The base package from which the tool will start looking for test cases.
# The test suite is automatically built by composition of all (recognized)
# test cases within the compiled tree, starting from this package.
# For example, if you specify org.openmicroscopy.shoola then the tool will
# look for test cases contained within the shoola package and all its
# sub-packages.  This property defaults to '.', which instructs the tool to
# scan all packages within the compiled tree.
BASE_PACKAGE = .


# A regex to tell the tool how to recognize the class file of a test case.
# When scanning the selected packages, the tool will take into account only
# class files whose name matches this pattern.  If the contained bytecode
# defines a class that extends junit.framework.TestCase, then the tool will
# extract all the contained test cases and add them to the suite.  If a file
# matches but doesn't contain valid bytecode or the class defined by that
# bytecode doesn't extend junit.framework.TestCase, then the tool will stop
# and output an error.
# The value of this property defines a match on all class files that start
# with 'test__' (note the 2 underscore characters).  The tool will take
# care of automatically excluding nested classes -- that is, 
# test__MyBigTest.class will match, but test__MyBigTest$1.class or
# test__MyBigTest$MyInnerClass.class won't.
# You shouldn't change the value of this property.

# Specifies whether or not the suite has to be run in the Swing UI.
# Write true for the Swing UI, false if you're a command line masochist.
