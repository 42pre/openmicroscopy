  <title>Categorising multiple images</title>

<p>
If you wish to add more than one image to the same 
category or categories, the steps described in 
<a href="section_4_7_4_1.html">Section 4.7.4.1</a> 
can be applied for multiple selected images. However in 
the current version of OMERO.insight you cannot select a 
dataset and then categorise all images within the dataset - 
you must select each image within the dataset.
