<p>Viewing images is a core function of OMERO.insight. Images are viewed in a separate window, using the Image Viewer. You can also view thumbnails of a selection of images you have individually chosen, or thumbnails of all images in one or more datasets, categories, category groups or projects, using the Hierarchy Viewer.
