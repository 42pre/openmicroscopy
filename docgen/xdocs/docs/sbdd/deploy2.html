<p>Installing and running Shoola is pretty easy. The following paragraphs detail the 
  procedure to follow if you're using the build system or have downloaded/generated 
  the generic or Mac OS X distribution bundle.</p>
<h5><i>Build System</i></h5>
<p>If you're using the build system, then move to the <i>config</i> directory under 
  <i>Shoola</i> and edit the <i>container.xml</i> file to specify the URL to the OME 
  Data Server (OMEDS). All you have to do is to modify the content of the <code>url</code> 
  tag within the following entry:</p>
<pre><code>    
  &lt;structuredEntry name=&quot;/services/OMEDS&quot; type=&quot;OMEDS&quot;&gt;
    &lt;url&gt;http://valewalker.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola&lt;/url&gt;
  &lt;/structuredEntry&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>You have to replace <code>http://valewalker.openmicroscopy.org.uk/shoola</code> 
  with the actual OMEDS URL in use at your site. Now move back to the <i>build</i> 
  directory and from there invoke the build system with the <code>run</code> target. 
  A splash screen will pop up, enter your user name and password to log onto the OME 
  server site.</p>
<div class="note"><b>Note for developers</b>: The <i>container.xml</i> file is under 
  version control. If you've only edited this file to enter the OMEDS URL to connect 
  to, then you shouldn't commit this file back to CVS.</div>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h5><i>Generic Bundle</i></h5>
<p>If you want to install the generic distribution bundle, just extract the archive 
  contents into the directory in which you intend to install and then edit (as described 
  above) the <i>container.xml</i> file, which you'll find in the <i>config</i> directory 
  under your installation directory. To run, just launch the start-up script for your 
  platform &#151; the installation directory contains scripts for Mac OS X, Unix, 
  and Windows. A splash screen will pop up, enter your user name and password to log 
  onto the OME server site.</p>
<div class="note"><b>Note for Linux/Mac OS X/Unix</b>: We experienced problems with 
  some GUI tools that deflate zip archives on Unix-like platforms. The original file 
  permissions were ignored/overwritten during the archive extraction phase. (Indeed, 
  there's no portable way to store these permissions. We use the Ant zip task which 
  in turn uses the algorithm used by the default versions of zip and unzip for many 
  Unix-like systems.) This resulted in having to set the executable bit for some files 
  manually after the extraction of the archive contents. If you're experiencing similar 
  problems, then proceed as follows after unzipping. Move to your installation directory 
  and from there type, at the command prompt: <code>chmod +x *.sh</code>
</div>

<h5><i>Mac OS X Bundle</i></h5>
<p>If you want to install the Mac OS X distribution bundle, just extract the archive 
  contents into the directory in which you intend to install and then edit (as described 
  above) the <i>container.xml</i> file, which you'll find in the <i>config</i> directory 
  under your installation directory. To run, just double-click on the Shoola icon 
  in your installation directory. A splash screen will pop up, enter your user name 
  and password to log onto the OME server site.</p>
<div class="note"> 
  <b>Note</b>: As already mentioned, we experienced problems with some GUI tools 
    that deflate zip archives. If you double-click on the Shoola icon and the application 
    doesn't start, then probably file permissions haven't been set properly during 
    the archive extraction phase. The fix is easy: open up a terminal and <code>cd</code> 
    to your installation directory. From there, again <code>cd</code> to <i>Shoola.app/Contents/MacOS</i>. 
    Now type: <code>chmod +x JavaApplicationStub</code>
