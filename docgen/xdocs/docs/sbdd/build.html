<p>
The build process is designed to be cross-platform and self-contained. What all
this means is that you can run the various build tasks (which we'll refer to as
'targets' in the remainder of this document) on any machine where a Java runtime
(JRE version 1.4 or later) is available, without having to worry about resolving
library dependencies. In fact, all the libraries required by the application and
test code as well as those needed for the build itself come in the CVS module
and are automatically linked as needed.
