<p> The build process is designed to be cross-platform and self-contained. What 
  all this means is that you can run the various build tasks (which we'll refer 
  to as <i>targets</i> in the remainder of this document) on any machine where 
  a Java runtime (JRE version 1.4 or later) is available, without having to worry 
  about resolving library dependencies. In fact, all the libraries required by 
  the application and test code as well as those needed for the build itself come 
  in the CVS module and are automatically linked as needed.</p>
<p>A convenience tool is povided to run any of the available build targets. This 
  tool operates from the command line, so you'll need to be a little familiar 
  with your operating system shell in order to use it. Move to the <i>build</i> 
  directory and from there type, at the command prompt:</p>
<pre><code>    java -jar build -p</code></pre>
<p>This will output a list of all available targets along with a short description 
  of what each target does. For a more detailed description simply type:</p>
<pre><code>    java -jar build</code></pre>
<p>To run a target, just specify the name of the target after <code>build</code> 
  on the command line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    java -jar build compile</code></pre>
<p>would compile the application sources. If you're an experienced Java developer, 
  you might have already guessed that we're using <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">Ant</a> 
  under the hood. In fact, the build tool simply forwards to Ant whatever follows 
  <code>build</code> on the command line. So, in general, you can use the build 
  tool as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    java -jar build [options] [target [target2 [target3] ...]]</code></pre>
<p>where <code>options</code> are any of the Ant options. For example:</p>
<pre><code>    java -jar build -e compile</code></pre>
<p>would output logging information on the console without adornments. (You can get the whole 
  list of Ant options by using the <code>-h</code> switch.)</p>
<p>The remainder of this section details the various build targets and provides 
  useful information related to the build process.</p>

<div class="note"><b>Note for developers</b>: The build tool is just a convenience 
  to save you the hassle of configuring Ant manually. If you prefer to use Ant directly, 
  there's some tweaking required first. This is described in a later <a href="build3.html">section</a>.</div>
