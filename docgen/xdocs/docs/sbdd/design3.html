<p>The build tool is a jar file named <i>build</i> and kept under the <i>build</i> 
  directory. Its purpose is to run a build without requiring Ant to be installed and 
  configured. The way it works is actually trivial. It contains a single class, <code>Builder</code>, 
  which is also the main class and whose <code>main</code> method simply forwards 
  the command line arguments to Ant. The manifest file links all the jar files under 
  the <i>build/tools</i> directory &#151; as a result, when the <i>build</i> file 
  is run, the JVM classpath will contain all those jars. Besides the external libraries 
  discussed in the previous sections, the <i>tools</i> directory also contains the 
  Ant core jars and the Ant jars for the optional tasks that we use as well as the 
  Sun JDK tools jar.</p>
<p>So the command <code>java -jar build</code> will result in invoking Ant with whatever 
  arguments follow <code>build</code> on the command line and with a classpath set 
  to contain all the jar files under <i>build/tools</i>. Because the classpath contains 
  all Ant core and optional libraries, all the external libraries, and the JDK tools, 
  all is effectively needed to run a build is a JRE &#151; as opposite to a whole 
  JDK, Ant, and all external libraries.</p>
<p>The <code>Builder</code> class and the <i>build</i> jar itself are generated by 
  an Ant build file: the <i>build.xml</i> file under the <i>build/tools</i> directory. 
  You can refer to the inline documentation in this file for further details on the 
  build tool.</p>

  <div class="noteContent">The <i>tools</i> directory also contains two XSL files. 
    These are the stylesheets used by the <code>junitreport</code> task to make test 
    reports. The reason why we're not using the embedded files that come with the 
    task is that the Xalan <code>redirect</code> declared in these files doesn't work 
    with some (nasty) configurations of JRE/Xalan. So we stripped those files out 
    and changed the <code>redirect</code> statement.</div>
