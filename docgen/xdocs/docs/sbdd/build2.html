<p>Shoola is entirely written in Java and you will need a Java Runtime Environment 
  (version 1.4 or later) to run it. All the third-party libraries required by Shoola 
  come already in each distribution bundle and are automatically linked at runtime, 
  so you won't have to worry about installing/upgrading libraries.</p>
<p>For the sake of record, here's a brief description of the third-party libraries 
  used by Shoola. First off, all of those libraries are stored in the <code>LIB</code> 
  directory under the CVS root. Its <code>test</code> sub-directory contains additional 
  libraries required by the test code &#151; these are not obviously included in the 
  distribution bundles. The libraries required by the Shoola source code are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>piccolo.jar</code> and <code>piccolox.jar</code>: The Piccolo graphics 
    framework (<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/">http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/jazz/</a>). 
    Version 1.0. These libraries are used by Shoola to build zoomable user interfaces.</li>
  <li><code>log4j-1.2.8.jar</code>: The Log4j logging framework (<a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/">http://logging.apache.org/log4j/</a>). 
    Version 1.2.8. This library provides logging facilities to Shoola.</li>
  <li><code>ome-java.jar</code>: This library is part of the OME distributions and 
    is used by Shoola as a gateway to the OME data and image servers.</li>
  <li><code>xmlrpc-1.2-b1.jar</code>: The Apache XmlRpc package (<a href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/">http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/</a>). 
    Version 1.2-b1. This library is not directly required by Shoola, but by the <code>ome-java.jar</code>, 
    which uses it to connect to the OME data server.</li>
  <li><code>commons-httpclient-2.0-rc2.jar</code>: The The Jakarta Commons HttpClient 
    (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/</a>). 
    Version 2.0-rc2. This library is not directly required by Shoola, but by the <code>ome-java.jar</code>, 
    which uses it to connect to the OME image server.</li>
  <li><code>commons-logging.jar</code>: The Jakarta Commons Logging (<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/</a>). 
    Version 1.0. This library is not directly required by Shoola, but by the <code>commons-httpclient-2.0-rc2.jar</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The additional libraries required by the test code are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>junit-3.8.1.jar</code>: The JUnit Testing Framework 
  (<a href="http://www.junit.org/">http://www.junit.org/</a>). Version: 3.8.1.</li>
</ul>
