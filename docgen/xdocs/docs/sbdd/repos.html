<p> The Shoola source code and related artifacts are hosted at our CVS server (<a href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/">http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/</a>). 
  The software configuration management for the whole OME project relies on this server; 
  Shoola is just one of the OME modules managed by this server. The CVS repository 
  can be browsed via a Web-based interface &#151; should you wish to do so, point 
  your Web browser to <a href="http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/cvsweb/">http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/cvsweb/</a>. 
  The Shoola root module is called Shoola, everything else is contained within this 
  directory.</p> 
<p>
The rest of this section describes the organization of the source code and 
related artifacts as well as how to retrieve them.</p>
