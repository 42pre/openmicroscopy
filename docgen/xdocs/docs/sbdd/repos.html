The Shoola source code and related artifacts are hosted at the Swedlow's lab in 
Dundee. The software configuration management for the whole OME project relies 
on the CVS server in Dundee; Shoola is just one of the OME modules managed by 
this server. The CVS repository can be browsed via a Web-based interface &#151;
should you wish to do so, point your Web browser to 
{http://cvs.openmicroscopy.org.uk/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/shoola/ VERIFY!!!!} or to 
[???] for viewing all the OME modules.  The Shoola root module is called Shoola,
everything else is contained within this directory.</p> 
<p>
The rest of this section describes the organization of the source code and 
related artifacts as well as how to retrieve them.</p>
