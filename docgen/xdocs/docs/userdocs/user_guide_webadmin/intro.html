<p>This document provides a brief guide to the Beta version of the
OMERO.webadmin software, released for general use in June 2007. The
OMERO.webadmin tool provides a simple interface to administer an OMERO
server.</p>
<p>The software has been developed as part of the Open Microscopy
Environment (OME) consortium. For more information on OMERO, including
information on bugs and updated versions, visit <a

</p>

<p>Web Admin is the basic application which allows managing users
and groups in Omero server. WebAdmin was build by the JavaServer Faces
(JSF), which is a Java-based Web application framework that simplifies
the development of user interfaces for Java EE applications. Unlike to
other traditional request-driven Model-View-Controller web frameworks,
JSF uses a component-based approach. The state of UI components are
saved when the client requests a new page and then they are restored
when the request is returned. Out of the box, JSF uses JavaServer Pages
for its display technology, but JSF can also accommodate other display
technologies. JSF includes:
<ul>
	<li>A set of APIs for representing user interface components and
	managing their state, handling events and input validation, converting
	values, defining page navigation, and supporting internationalization
	and accessibility.</li>
	<li>A default set of user interface components.</li>
	<li>A server-side event model.</li>
	<li>State management.</li>
	<li>Managed Beans (JavaBeans created with dependency injection).</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>The rest of the guide is arranged as follows:

</ul>
We hope you enjoy using the software.
