<p>The four channel buttons (457, 528, 617, 685 in 
<a href="section_4_8_2_1.html#figure_25">Figure 4.8.2.1-2</a>) 
enable you to <b>turn on or off</b> specific channels 
for multi-channel images. Turning on or off a channel will 
result in an immediate visual change to the image shown in the Image Viewer.</p>
<p>
The colour band selected for a given channel corresponds to 
the emission wavelength of the channel. If this information is 
not available, the channels will be mapped to red, green and blue. 
The colour used to display any channel can be customised using the 
Colour Picker (<a href="section_4_8_2_1_2.html">Section 4.8.2.1.2</a>).
</p>
<p>Channels can be turned on or off by clicking the relevant channel 
selection button, aligned vertically on the left edge of the 
<b><i>Image Viewer</i></b> window. Buttons show the colour 
associated with the channel, plus wavelength in nanometres 
(if this information is available).
