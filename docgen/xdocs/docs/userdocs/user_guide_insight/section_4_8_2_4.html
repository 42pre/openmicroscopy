  <title>Viewing z-sections and timepoints</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>For images with multiple z-sections and/or timepoints, the Image Viewer can allow manual or automated viewing of each section. Z-sections and timepoints can be viewed separately or together. Viewing is controlled using the relevant sliders to the right of the Channel toolbar (see Figure 25).</p>
<p>
The information in the status bar at the bottom of the <b><i>Image Viewer</i></b> window shows which z-section and timepoint is currently being displayed.
</p>
<p>
 <b><i>NB</i></b>  If the current image has only one z-section or timepoint, viewing options are disabled (greyed out).
