</head>
<body>
<p>
The central part of <b>OMERO.insight</b>, and the part of the application you will see once logged in, is known as the Data Manager. This is where you can organise your images into logical groups ready for viewing individually or in groups.
</p>
<p>
As you use the Data Manager, you will also become familiar with the other two main features of OMERO.insight:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The <b>Image Viewer</b> - for viewing and manipulating an individual 
image - including enabling multi-dimensional viewing.</li><li>The <b>Hierarchy Viewer</b> - for viewing and manipulating thumbnails of groups of images.</li>
</ol>
<p>
More information on using the Image Viewer and Hierarchy Viewer is provided in the appropriate sections of this User Guide.</p>
