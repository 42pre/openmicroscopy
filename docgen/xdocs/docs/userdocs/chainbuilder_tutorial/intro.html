<p>The Chainbuilder is a Shoola agent that supports the browsing and
  examination of OME's library of analysis modules and chains, and
  the use of those components to construct new chains. This document
  will provide a brief overview of the various components of the
  chainbuilder, along with descriptions of how they interact and
  instructions for adding constructed chains to the database.</p>

<p>The Chainbuilder is built around the concept of <em>palettes</em>:
libraries of components that can be dragged and dropped onto
a <em>canvas</em> to form the basis of new chains.</p>

<p> Analysis modules are the basic building blocks from which new
  chains are created. The <A HREF="mods.html">module palette</A>
  displays the available modules in a 2D-layout, grouped by
  category.</p>

<p>Existing chains can also be used as starting points for creation
  of new chains. The <A HREF="chains.html">chain palette</A> displays
  all of   the available chains in the database.</p>

<p>Chains and modules provide the building blocks for new chains. To
build a chain, open a new <A HREF="creation.html">chain creation
canvas</A>, drag and drop chains and modules onto the canvas, create
connections between the appropriate inputs and outputs, and then save
the chain. Newly saved chains will be added to the <A
HREF="chains.html">chain palette</A>. </p>

<p>The first step in creating a chain is to start the chainbuilder by
pressing the chainbuilder button <img src="images/chains.png"

builder is shown below.</p>
