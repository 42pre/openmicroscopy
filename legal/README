  Preamble
  --------
  
  Within this document, the term 'third-party software' shall refer to the set 
  of all the files which are contained in the Shoola CVS module and which are 
  listed in each 'Artifacts' entry within the 'Third-Party Software Licenses' 
  section of this document.  The term 'Shoola' or, equivalently, 'our software'
  shall refer to any other file contained in the Shoola CVS module.
  
  
  
  Purpose
  -------
  
  This document states which licenses apply to which files in the Shoola CVS
  module.  It also gives credit to other projects and developers that provided
  us with their valuable software.
  
  
  
  OME-Shoola License
  ------------------
  
  Our software is licensed under the terms of the Lesser General Public License
  (LGPL), a copy of which may be found in the 'lgpl.txt' file within this
  directory.
  
  
  
  Third-Party Software Licenses
  -----------------------------
  
  We are in debt with many open-source projects for providing us with valuable
  artifacts, ranging from application libraries to graphics files.  This section
  lists all the third-party software that is used by Shoola.  Software artifacts
  are grouped according to the project of provenience and using the following 
  format:
  
  Project: The name of the project the artifacts belong to and a brief 
  		(optional) description.
  Web Site: The project's Web site address.
  Artifacts: The files our software makes use of.  The wildcard character * can
  		be appended to a sequence of characters S denoting a file name.  
  		This shall mean 'all the files whose name starts with S'.  For example, 
  		'ant-*' means all the files whose name starts with 'ant-'.
  		Unless otherwise specified, directory pathnames are given relative to the
  		root of the Shoola CVS module.
  License: The type of license that applies to the files listed in 'Artifacts'.
  License File: The file, within this directory, that contains the license.
