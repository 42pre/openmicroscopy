   OMERO - OME Read-Only Web App
-------------------------------------------------

Building clients that access the Omero service is 
as easy as having omero-client.jar and omero-model.jar
on your classpath.

Then create a ServiceFactory and use it to obtain a Service.

    ServiceFactory services = new ServiceFactory();
    HierarchyBrowsing proxy = services.getHierarchyBrowsingService();
