  <title>Managing windows in OMERO.insight</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>As you work with images in OMERO.insight, you may end up with several open windows. The <b><i>Windows</i></b> menu, available at all times, shows all windows you have currently open in OMERO.insight, and allows you to jump between windows. 
</p>
<p>
This means you can, for example, move between the Data Manager and any open Hierarchy Viewer windows or Image Viewer windows by selecting from the available options in the <b><i>Windows</i></b> menu.
