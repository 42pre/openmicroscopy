<body>
<p>For images with multiple z-sections and/or timepoints, the Image Viewer 
can allow manual or automated viewing of each section. The z-sections and 
timepoints can be viewed separately or together. Viewing is 
controlled using the relevant sliders to the right of the Channel toolbar 
(<a href="section_4_8_2_1.html#figure_25">Figure 4.8.2.1-1</a>).</p>
<p>
The information in the status bar at the bottom of the 
<b><i>Image Viewer</i></b> window shows which z-section and timepoint 
is currently being displayed.
</p>
<div class="noteFrame">
  <div class="noteLabel">NB</div>
  <div class="noteContent">
If the current image has only one z-section or timepoint, viewing 
options are disabled (greyed out).
