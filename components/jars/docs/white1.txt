White Paper : Categories, Annotations, and Other Metadata
 Josh Moore
 
 In order to differentiate between our various forms of 
 
 Data for us is actually the pixels. However, of our metadata, some is also more data like. 
 
 1) Categories
  -set
  -not Attributes (no mexes)
  -touchgraphs would be a good gui
  -possible use case: visualize n groups, if they are distinct, add them to a category group
 
 2) Annotations
  -links to external information or prose (non semantic information, *.doc *.ppt ...)
  -gui is basically a web browser ("rendering")
  =
  
 3) the other metadata in the system consists of "original data" (import data) and that contained in attributes.
