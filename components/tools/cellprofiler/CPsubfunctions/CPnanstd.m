function m = CPnanstd(x)
%CPNANSTD Standard deviation, ignoring NaNs.  
%   M = CPNANSTD(X) returns the sample standard deviation of X, treating
%   NaNs as missing values.  For vector input, M is the standard
%   deviation of the non-NaN elements in X.  For matrix input, M is a
%   row vector containing the standard deviation of non-NaN elements in
%   each column.  For N-D arrays, CPNANSTD operates along the first
%   non-singleton dimension.
%
%   This function will need rewriting if it needs to take stds
%   along any dimension other than the first.  Also, it only accepts
%   vectors and 2D matrices at this time.
