The licenses component is responsible for providing an
extension point for third-parties to integrate license
requirements into their clients. A license store should
be configured in the top-level etc/omero.properties file
under the name "ome.services.licenses.Store_class". This
value will be hard-coded into the licensing interceptor
which checks all method calls in OMERO.

This component is also an example of how to integrate your
external code into the OMERO build. Copying the entire
licenses directory to another directory under tools/ and
modifying as necessary will provide a complete build incl.
OmeroPy, OmeroCpp, and OmeroJava for your code.
