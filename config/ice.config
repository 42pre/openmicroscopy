# OmeroBlitz configuration file
#
# This file is usable by all clients to connect to the Blitz server,
# and is also usable for manual calls to `java -jar blitz.jar` outside
# of the IceGrid framework. Rather than editing this file, it is possible
# to use a multiple file argument to Ice.Config, e.g.:
#
#   --Ice.Config=etc/ice.config,etc/private.config
#

# User properties
# ---------------
# These properties are required for connecting to a server. The
# IP address is critical for a proper connection. Many clients
# will provide the username and password at runtime, but for
# running scripts and similarly it may be useful to define it
# here.

# Determines the maximum size of any single message which
# can be recieved from or sent to OMERO.blitz. This value
# can be lowered to prevent memory exhaustion, but if an
# overly large message is sent to the client, then an
# exception will be thrown. If the client tries to send
# too much information in one call to the server, the
# server's setting for MessageSizeMax will determine
# whether or not an exception is thrown.
