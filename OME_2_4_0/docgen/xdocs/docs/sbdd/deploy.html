<p>OME is a client/server system. The server software stores, manages, and analyzes 
  image data and metadata. A server site encompasses data and image servers and is 
  deployed on a powerful server machine. The OME servers expose network interfaces 
  so that client software can connect to them and perform tasks on behalf of users. 
  Shoola is one of such clients. Client software is (usually) deployed on desktop 
  machines or workstations.</p>
<p>Installing and running Shoola is very easy: drop the distribution directory somewhere 
  on your filesystem, edit a line in a configuration file, and run! This section details 
  all this more precisely. An obvious pre-requisite is that the OME server site you 
  intend to connect to is up and running and you have a valid account.</p>
