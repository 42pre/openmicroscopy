<p> OME's zoomable browser provides a compact overview of OME
  projects, datasets, and the images they contain. This manual will
  provide a quick introduction to using the browser to navigate
  through OME data.</p>

<p>
The zoomable browser is designed to help users navigate the two main
data containers in OME: <em>projects</em> and <em>datasets</em>. A
project is generally seen as an ongoing effort involving multiple
sets of images, known as. A dataset can also be included in multiple
projects. In database terms, there is a many-to-many relationship
between projects and datasets.A similar many-to-many relationship
exists between datasets and images: any image may be found in
multiple datasets.</p>

<p>
OME also supports the notice of <em>ownership</em> of projects,
datasets, images, and related entities. The zoomable browser will
only show dataset objects that are owned by the user who is
currently logged in to the system.</p>

<p>Projects and datasets are displayed in two areas in the zoomable
  browser window. The top section of the window contains projects
  listed by name, while the bottom section contains graphical
  representations of the images in various datasets. Each dataset is
  shown as a rectangular region, containing thumbnails for each of
  the contained images.</p>
