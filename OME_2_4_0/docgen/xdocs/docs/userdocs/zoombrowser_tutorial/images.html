The dataset views contain miniaturized thumbnails for each of the
images in a dataset. The space allocated to each dataset is
proportional to the logarithm of the dataset size. This allows very
large datasets to be shown alongside much smaller datasets, without
overwhelming (as would likely happen if display size was linearly
proportional to the dataset size), but it also means that thumbnails
can be very small when datasets are large.</p>

<p>When the mouse is moved over a thumbnail, a tooltip will provide
additional detail that might be useful for interpretation. If the
thumbnail is relatively large, this tooltip will only contain the
name of the image. For smaller thumbnails, the tooltip will contain a
larger thumbnail. If the image is found in other datasets, the
appropriate thumbnails in those datasets will be highlighted.</p>

A progressive zoom facility is provided for navigating large
datasets. When the mouse is moved over a thumbnail in a large
dataset, a mouse click will lead to an animated zoom to a display
containing a subset of the images in the datasets.  Subsequent clicks
will zoom in further, untilthe number of thumbnails displayed is
small enough to allow for individual viewing.</p>

<p>
To zoom out of a zoomed-in display, right-click on an image. A
popup-menu context menu will be displayed. The first choice on this
menu is &quot;Zoom out&quot;. This menu also contains choices for
viewing the image in the OME image viewer, and viewing the image
information. </p>
